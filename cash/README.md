***Note：***

To see if Node is installed, type node -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v0.10.31.

To see if NPM is installed, type npm -v in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 1.4.27

If you didn't install npm and node.js before, you should install them.

Maybe you can get some help to install `NPM` and `node.js`:
